This java application is a simple java gui that allows the user to click buttons
that will draw shapes on a canvas. The point of this assignment was to write the
program using various design patterns. This application uses java swing to
create the gui. Once started, the user will see a window with buttons on the
left side and a white canvas on the right. There are buttons named 'square',
'circle', 'Hello!', 'Undo', 'Redo' and 'Clear'. The user can click on a button
and then click a point on the canvas where the object is to be drawn. The
shape buttons will draw that shape, the Hello! button will draw 'Hello World!'.
The undo button will undo the last drawn item, and the user can keep pressing
the button until the screen is cleared. The redo button will redraw any undone
objects. The clear button will completely clear the canvas.
